    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by slicing your vegetables and cutting the beef into strips.</li>
            <li>Set a medium-sized pot of water to boil over medium heat. Weâ€™ll need it later for the noodles. </li>
            <li>Heat some oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the beef with black pepper. Brown the beef in the wok, stirring frequently. This took approximately 4-5 minutes. Set the beef aside. </li>
            <li>Wipe out the wok (if needed) and heat a little more oil over medium-high heat. Add all of the vegetables and the shiitake mushrooms. </li>
            <li>Stir fry the veggies for 3-4 minutes and then add the beef back to the wok. </li>
            <li>When the water is boiling, add the noodles to the pot. Cooking times will vary depending on the noodles you use. Check the package of the product you buy to get the timing right.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked noodles and sauce to the wok. Turn the stovetop heat to high and stir frequently, letting everything absorb most of the sauce. This should take no more than 2-3 minutes. </li>
            <li>Garnish your beef yakisoba and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
